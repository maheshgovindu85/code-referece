Good morning, and thank you for this opportunity. My name is Mahesh Govindu. I have 3.6 years of experience as a Software Developer, with over 2 years in my current role at P-Mech Technology Pvt. Ltd., a product-based company in the mechanical domain.

My primary expertise is in front-end development using Angular (currently working with Angular 14 and above), and I have hands-on experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, and UI libraries like PrimeNG, Angular Material, DevExtreme, and Bootstrap.

I’ve worked across various domains including HR systems, Insurance, E-commerce, and Oil & Gas projects. I focus on creating clean, reusable, and scalable components using best practices. I also have experience with RxJS, NgRx, REST API integration, and have contributed to both individual and team-based Agile projects.

Recently, I received an award in my organization for outstanding contribution to multiple projects, and I’m always eager to learn and take on new challenges.

I’m now looking for a role where I can grow further as a Front-End Developer, contribute to innovative solutions, and collaborate with skilled professionals—making Infosys a great opportunity that aligns with my career goals.”
